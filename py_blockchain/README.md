Each block contains information about the timestamp, the transaction, the hash and previous hash and nonce. Also the blockchain is composed
by the chain( the list that holds all the blocks inside the blockchain), unverified transactions (a list that represents all the unverified transactions before being passed into a block) and the genesis block (a block automatically generated when the block chain is initiated)
